                        <p>
                        Data analysis starts with collection and transformation, the foundation to make your data sparkle.

                        <p>
                        You've got some data and cool ideas to make predictions.
                        But where do you start?

                        Then, if you want to take it to the next level, I can also help you move the model into production.

                        <h4>Algorithmic bias testing</h4>
                        <p>
                        All algorithms make assumptions.
                        But bias, even unintentional, can cause serious problems for an application.

                        </p>

            <p>
            My engagement model is meant to be easy for you.
            <ul>
            <li><b>1 week iterations</b> - frequent checkpoints allow us to learn and adjust quickly.</li>
            <li><b>No long-term obligations</b> - we plan sprint-to-sprint without contracts, which makes it easy for you to start and reduces your risk.</li>
            <li><b>Pay for what you need</b> - engage week-to-week, press pause whenever you like, and scale up or down my contribution effort (see below).</li>
            <li><b>Get what you pay for</b> - receive assets for the project with each iteration that you own and possess.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <b>Costs</b>
            <p>
            I charge for data science contribution units, which are priced at $1000 per unit.
            Each contribution is equal to approximately 1/4 the effort of a full-time experienced Data Scientist.
            </p>
            <p>
            In planning, I estimate how many units each discrete body of work would entail in a logarithmic scale—0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5 units—based on complexity.
            Planning is not a commitment on your part—<u>you decide priorities and select what work I actually take on</u>.
            Then, you pay for the units that we agree upon for a task, not the actual work time.
